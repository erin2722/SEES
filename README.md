Map comparing Extreme weather conditions and vulnerable communities. 
      This application overlays extreme heat and cold watches, warnings, and heat advisorys with the poorer counties in the
      United States. This map considers a county with an unemployment rate over 16% to be poor. After mapping the data, it
      displays all affected poor counties in the side bar. This app was made for the 2017 NASA/SEES internship at the Center 
      for Space Reseach in Austin, Texas.
